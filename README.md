Pirozhki generator (python 2.7)
This is a generator of 'pirozhki' - poems consisting of four lines in the iambic tetrameter that are popular in the Russian Internet.
The text generator uses the NLTK library for generating language models. The tokenizer was written by the author.
The file 'textgen_new.py' contains the main code of the generator. Unfortunately, comments in the main code are currently only in Russian.
The files '10_corpus_wa_ed.txt' and '500_corpus_wa_ed.txt' contain corpora of 10 thsd. and 500 thsd. words each with Russian text (taken from different works by L. Tolstoi) with accentuated words so that the generator can work with them.
In the files 'generated_from_10_corpus_wa_ed.txt' and 'generated_from_500_corpus_wa_ed.txt' are examples of pirozhki generated from each of the corpora.
